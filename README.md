<strong><em>About This Project:</strong></em>

<p>&nbsp;<p>

Data is stored in a .JSON file which has an array of objects that represent each image+caption. The data for each image+caption is dynamically generated to a single card component. After casually using Tumblr specifically to post my personal photographs and nothing else since 2010, I got to thinking, "Why not make this a React App project?".. So I exported all of my Photo Journal media and rebuilt it in a React setting. Writing Python scripts made extracting the captions possible. I used Infinite scroll to avoid pagination when a user is traveling back in time. I have written logic for "Header" and "Footer" Navigation icons. The first pair is at the very top of the Photo Journal collection. One icon allows the user to scroll down to the first photo that I ever posted on my previous Tumblr account back in 2010. The other icon will take you to any random photograph posted in the past. I have made similar Navigation icons down at the footer. A user can scroll back up to the most recent object (image+caption) as well as scroll to any random photo in the archive. There are "General Navigation Icons" that I've mapped starting after the 5th image in the Photo Journal roll to keep anyone browsing the page sane.
